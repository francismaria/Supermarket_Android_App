## What is it?

The project consisted in creating an Android application to simulate a supermarket app where the users could shop with their smartphones only. Below is the transcript of the project's requirements.

*"A supermarket – call it the Acme Electronic Supermarket – intends to implement a more efficient shopping and payment system supplying an Android app to its customers.*

*The idea asks for the customers to register the products in the app, when they put them in the shop basket. When they are ready to leave, they check out the products in the basket passing or showing the phone in a terminal. The payment is made (using the associated credit or debit card) and the gate doors are opened.*

*Using the app, the customers should first make a registration (only once when they use the app for the first time) in the supermarket remote service, supplying personal data and payment card data for payments. Also, an asymmetric cryptographic key pair is generated, being the private key securely stored in the device.*

*At any time, the app should be capable of consulting past transactions’ information, and retrieve available emitted loyalty vouchers, that can concede a discount in some future buy. A loyalty voucher is offered whenever the customer accumulated payments surpassed a multiple of some value."*
